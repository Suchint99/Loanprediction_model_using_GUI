Its an Updated version of Loabprediction Model

Save Model with Neural Networks
This project demonstrates how to train, save, and reuse a machine learning model using TensorFlow/Keras. The notebook guides you through:
Building and training a neural network on customer/admission data.
Saving the trained model in .h5 format for future use.
Loading the saved model without retraining.
Making predictions on new input data through a simple function.
(Optional) Adding a user-friendly interface (GUI) so users can input values (like age, score, balance, etc.) and instantly see the prediction (e.g., Will the student get admitted? Will the customer churn?).

ðŸŽ› GUI Idea (if you want to add it)
You can extend this notebook with a simple GUI using:
Tkinter (desktop app with text boxes and a predict button)
or Streamlit (web-based app where users enter values in sliders/text boxes).
That way, someone can interact with the model visually instead of coding.
